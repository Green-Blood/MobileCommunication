# MobileCommunication project
## BPSK modulation with a carrier.
### What have we done:
    1. Taking an image and splitting it to an RGB channels
    2. BPSK modulation
    3. Adding noise
    4. Demodulating
    5. Ploting a demodulated image with noise added
    6. Calculating a BER (Bit error rate)
